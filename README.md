OUR MISSION
We believe programming is the most and some day maybe the main, perhaps even the only important and relevant general education.
It will soon be like reading/writing - you can have other knowledge too, but without reading/writing its hard to acquire and use it.
The UK made programming mandatory for every kid starting from primary school on and some countries followed.
The US has awesome nation wide programs like "Code for America" - but sadly the ruling christian party in Germany is slowing down progress on "that front".
Our long term goal is to teach programming to as many kids as possible and free of charge, as we feel people in Germany are falling behind fast and maybe we can do something about it, because the government does not seem to care.


OUR GOAL
We want to scale the school as fast as possible regarding
sponsors
kids / learners
weekly lessons we give
...because there will be lots of synergy effects we can realize, => which will result in a lower price for each kid.


OUR PRICING
We calculated our pricing and cost structure and we aim to publish it soon, because we believe in total transparency when it comes to business.
Currently, it takes a lot of time, because we are...
Preparing the program we teach
Doing the bureaucracy (setting up a company, talking to accountant, filling out forms, ...)
Doing the marketing (website, flyers, small online campaigns, ...)
Booking the room & Actually being there every Monday afternoon to teach
It's quite some effort for us and our freelance activities currently earn us way more money for the time we spend to get the job done,
so we use that fact to be able to give away some "Early Bird Discounts" - but that's not a long term option, because we need the school to become sustainable.


OUR NEXT STEPS  => Here we need you :-)
Next to our regular work, we are constantly approaching sponsors in order to be able to lower the costs for kids, but it takes time and the same is true for marketing in order to reach out to more kids/parents. As soon as we have some (sponsors or more kids), we will announce it and lower the prices for all kids and in the mean time:
If your company or people/companies you know might be potential sponsors that would help us to speed up the process and the parent who helped will benefit the most.
Our "Voucher Program" (mentioned in the last email) can lower costs for each kid in the mean time, thus, if Ethan has some friends who are interested too, it will lower the costs for Ethan and the new kids by 50% for a month and permanently lower it by 10% for the kid that brought in a new kid, as long as it stays.
For now, all the effort we put in is to the benefit of "Taymal" and "Ethan" and soon a third kid.
