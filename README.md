# @WizardAmigos Concept
## `v1.0.0-first-draft`


## `Manifesto` (Idea)
What we are trying to build is:
* A decentralized open source javascript learn & work ecosystem
* `mentors` make & maintain a hyper modular lessons depedency tree and
* earn micro percentages from making and maintaining in demand lessons
* to offer any `client` to publish paid tasks next to required lessons
* and to enable a flood of `learners` to
* earn nano certificates and micro percentages while they learn
* developers are encouraged to take on the roles of
	* `mentors`, `clients` and `learners` to earn and grow the ecosystem


## `Mechanism`
#### 1. Goal: Mentors grow and maintain a healthy modular lessons tree
* **Incentivize:** `Mentors` - Open Source Developers & Hacktivists
	* `Mentors` can promote skills by making lessons for them
	* `Mentors` can attract paid tasks matching their interests
	* `Mentors` earn a micro percentage from paid tasks from every
		* lesson they maintain and the dependent lessons
	* `Mentors` earn micro percentages whenever they decide to do tasks
* **Execution** We make a list of developers who want to join.
	* We list and connect our skills into a granular skill tree
	* Come up with an immersive educational storybook format
	* Make & maintain lessons for skills (and earn micro percentages)

#### 2. Goal: Clients outsource paid tasks matching skill tree lessons
* **Incentivize:** `Clients` - People, Companies, Organizations & Gov's
	* `Clients` get their problems solved in a sustainable fashion
		* `ecosystem` assures lots of devs with maintainance skills
	* `Clients` reduce the amount of money they spent on finding devs
	* `Clients` get listed as supporters of the ecosystem after paying a finished task
	* `Clients` improve their image for supporting open source
	* `Clients` reduce risk of getting stuck with outdated frameworks
	* `Clients` turn fixed costs for employees into variable costs 
* **Execution** We search/scrape all existing online jobs/gig platforms
	* to cherry pick **`remote`** priced tasks that fit the skill tree
	* offer them to be published as supporters after paying a for tasks
* **Execution** We contact remote friendly companies and offer/apply to 
	* those who want to publish paid remote tasks matching tree lessons
		* tasks go into a lesson related kanban board (waffle.io for example)
		* or a general one if lessons are missing
	* those who want a task done, pay money immediately to our escrow service
	* try to semi-automate that process as good as possible

#### 3. Goal: Learners get paid while learning how to code
* **Incentivize:** `Learners` - All humans (beginners & experts) :-)
	* `Learners` can browse listed tasks to see learning is worth it
	* `Learners` who solve lessons earn modular nano certificates
		* that unlock them for listed tasks
	* `Learners` earn for executing the tasks 
	* `Learners` can learn & work flexibly when they have time
	* `Learners` dont spend too much time for overhead activities like:
		* interviewing/applying/commuting/...
	* `Learners` can earn margin by outsourcing as `Clients` to others
		* by outsourcing modular subtasks to other learners
	* `Learners` have long term perspective by making
		* their own apps later alone or with other
	* `Learners` do not have to worry about accounting bureaucracy
* **Execution** We inform unaware learners
	* about the ongoing automation of the economy
	* about the opportunity to earn while learning how to code
* **Execution** We notify subscribed learners (round robin style?)
	* to check new available paid tasks that match their skills
* **Execution** We standardize transactions to automate accounting
	* and all kinds of reports necessary where possible
* **Execution** We encourage experienced learners to take on big tasks
	* and split them into modular sub-tasks for less experienced ones

#### 4. Goal: Work together cooperatively in a growing ecosystem
* **Incentivize:**
	* `Learners`, `Clients` and `Mentors` will be "insured"
	* `Learners` can earn by using the ecosystem as `Clients` or `Mentors`
* **Execution** We pay out finshed tasks based on share distribution
	* to everyone according to their contribution
* **Execution** We encourage advanced Learners to launch products
	* By collaborating with other mentors & learners

#### Future Goal: Make the world one and overcome nation borders
* **Shift to the demand-side economics and mutal aid network instead of
supply-side competition**
	* Building our own products/services and connect them API-to-API
* **Incentivize**
	* People can move and life their life's freely :-)
* **Execution** We make a network of co-learning/working/living spaces 
	* Check VISA and other bureaucracy and loopholes to enable travel
	* Search for affordable housing and food matching lifestyles
	* Organize co-working & co-learning
	* Provide Infrastructure to make stuff happen :-)
