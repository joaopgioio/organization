# @WizardAmigos Concept
## `v1.0.0-first-draft`

## Want to start your local Wizard Amigos group? 
# How to organize Wizard Amigos meetup

>All you need is:
>* a free community space (in Berlin that's CoUp event space and in Taiwan Mozilla community space and now one private space by @jefferysac who started a new Taiwanese group)
>* we publish event on meetup.com/codingamigos (Berlin based meetup is called CodingAmigos but we list all events in the same group, Wizard and Coding amigos)
>* you come to the event every week or once in 2 weeks or 2x a week, however you can, but regularly and you act as a host, greeting new people, tell them the story of why and how the community works, you get them to know the chat and learning tools, and then you basically learn and work together on this meetups, each on their own thing, but sharing, discussing, supporting each other
>* And by providing space for people to come and learn and share time for common interest (code, javascript, nomadic lifestyle, self employment, open source, blockchain and p2p web, activism etc.) your group will slowly grow and people will come back because it's free, it's cozy, it's a nice group of like-minded people and it's even part of international community so you can find your 'amigos = friends' in Berlin, Taiwan and in the future also other places 

### Space

- big table, people sit around (community feeling)

### How does it work

- no presentation, more co-learning, co-working
- with computers

### New people

- take care of them, help them to connect to the group
- ask about their interests, background and try to connect them to the like-minded in the group
- host(s) introduce the chat and help people sign up
- introduction to Wizard Amigos (if they are interested) and to learning resources

### Hosts (one or more)

- not authority, but more of a 'keyholder'
- make events possible 
- update meetup.com (if events are cancelled etc.)
- take pictures and upload on FB group and meetup.com so other wizards from other countries can imagine who are people in the chat and to easier connect with each other 

### Members

- respect each other
- take care every member has enough space to express themselves (also the shy ones)
- support and help each other
- share knowledge

### People often ask 
- Why there is no specific topic? 
- Do you guys already start to work remotely with each other?

## `Manifesto` (Idea)
What we are trying to build is:
* A decentralized open source javascript learn & work ecosystem
* `mentors` make & maintain a hyper modular lessons depedency tree and
* earn micro percentages from making and maintaining in demand lessons
* to offer any `client` to publish paid tasks next to required lessons
* and to enable a flood of `learners` to
* earn nano certificates and micro percentages while they learn
* developers are encouraged to take on the roles of
	* `mentors`, `clients` and `learners` to earn and grow the ecosystem


## `Mechanism`
#### 1. Goal: Mentors grow and maintain a healthy modular lessons tree
* **Incentivize:** `Mentors` - Open Source Developers & Hacktivists
	* `Mentors` can promote skills by making lessons for them
	* `Mentors` can attract paid tasks matching their interests
	* `Mentors` earn a micro percentage from paid tasks from every
		* lesson they maintain and the dependent lessons
	* `Mentors` earn micro percentages whenever they decide to do tasks
* **Execution** We make a list of developers who want to join.
	* We list and connect our skills into a granular skill tree
	* Come up with an immersive educational storybook format
	* Make & maintain lessons for skills (and earn micro percentages)

#### 2. Goal: Clients outsource paid tasks matching skill tree lessons
* **Incentivize:** `Clients` - People, Companies, Organizations & Gov's
	* `Clients` get their problems solved in a sustainable fashion
		* `ecosystem` assures lots of devs with maintainance skills
	* `Clients` reduce the amount of money they spent on finding devs
	* `Clients` get listed as supporters of the ecosystem after paying a finished task
	* `Clients` improve their image for supporting open source
	* `Clients` reduce risk of getting stuck with outdated frameworks
	* `Clients` turn fixed costs for employees into variable costs 
* **Execution** We search/scrape all existing online jobs/gig platforms
	* to cherry pick **`remote`** priced tasks that fit the skill tree
	* offer them to be published as supporters after paying a for tasks
* **Execution** We contact remote friendly companies and offer/apply to 
	* those who want to publish paid remote tasks matching tree lessons
		* tasks go into a lesson related kanban board (waffle.io for example)
		* or a general one if lessons are missing
	* those who want a task done, pay money immediately to our escrow service
	* try to semi-automate that process as good as possible

#### 3. Goal: Learners get paid while learning how to code
* **Incentivize:** `Learners` - All humans (beginners & experts) :-)
	* `Learners` can browse listed tasks to see learning is worth it
	* `Learners` who solve lessons earn modular nano certificates
		* that unlock them for listed tasks
	* `Learners` earn for executing the tasks 
	* `Learners` can learn & work flexibly when they have time
	* `Learners` dont spend too much time for overhead activities like:
		* interviewing/applying/commuting/...
	* `Learners` can earn margin by outsourcing as `Clients` to others
		* by outsourcing modular subtasks to other learners
	* `Learners` have long term perspective by making
		* their own apps later alone or with other
	* `Learners` do not have to worry about accounting bureaucracy
* **Execution** We inform unaware learners
	* about the ongoing automation of the economy
	* about the opportunity to earn while learning how to code
* **Execution** We notify subscribed learners (round robin style?)
	* to check new available paid tasks that match their skills
* **Execution** We standardize transactions to automate accounting
	* and all kinds of reports necessary where possible
* **Execution** We encourage experienced learners to take on big tasks
	* and split them into modular sub-tasks for less experienced ones

#### 4. Goal: Work together cooperatively in a growing ecosystem
* **Incentivize:**
	* `Learners`, `Clients` and `Mentors` will be "insured"
	* `Learners` can earn by using the ecosystem as `Clients` or `Mentors`
* **Execution** We pay out finshed tasks based on share distribution
	* to everyone according to their contribution
* **Execution** We encourage advanced Learners to launch products
	* By collaborating with other mentors & learners
* **Related Projects**

#### Future Goal: Make the world one and overcome nation borders
* **Shift to the demand-side economics and mutal aid network instead of
supply-side competition**
	* Building our own products/services and connect them API-to-API
* **Incentivize**
	* People can move and life their life's freely :-)
* **Execution** We make a network of co-learning/working/living spaces 
	* Check VISA and other bureaucracy and loopholes to enable travel
	* Search for affordable housing and food matching lifestyles
	* Organize co-working & co-learning
	* Provide Infrastructure to make stuff happen :-)
