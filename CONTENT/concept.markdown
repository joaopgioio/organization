                                      Classes of Magic

Wizard Amigos Institute will start running from May 1, 2015 on.

Class of Magic (May 4 - Jun 22, 2015)

Class of Magic (May 14 - Jul 2, 2015)

Each class will last 3 full hours. It will accept up to 10 learners and will be run by at least 2 higher-level wizards. For each meetup we will try to prepare short screencasts and other materials with different assignments. For all who want to do more there will also be homework so learners will be able to practice their spells. We also encourage all the participants to have some project they want to work on (but if they don't, no worries, will help them find one).

First meeting is going to be informal and will include helping learners get set up with Linux and getting started with some of the basics. The "formal" class part will begin the second week.

Hack-and-tell days will also be organised and wizards will be able to share what they are working on there. This will be easy going events where learners will be able to get some feedback and to inspire those who want to join wizard amigos.

                                       Unlocking Charm

There are some requirements for the Classes of Magic.

You need to have your own computer. It doesn't have to be super powerful, but you need one. It needs to run on Mac OS or Linux. If you have Windows, we will help you install Linux.

You also have to be able to understand some basic English. Most of the programming materials, tutorials and games are in English. Mentors do speak German (and English is their second language), so you will be able to speak German, but you really have to be able to understand English.
