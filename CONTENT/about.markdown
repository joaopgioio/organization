## Our story
In early 2014 we started Coding Amigos Hackathons in Berlin. We organized over 70 events and co-learning workshops. Before that we participated in several groups: University Incubator, Social Media Week, Rails Girls, StartUp weekend, Open Tech School etc.

During last year we have met a lot of coding learners and got to know several techniques for beginners and advanced learners. We realised we have enough experiences to bring this skills also to the youngest segment. And so the idea for programming institute was born.

Programming is a new literacy

Wizard Amigos Institute has opened its doors in May 2015.
